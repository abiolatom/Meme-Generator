# Meme-Generator

This is one the first fun project I completed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The inspiration and guidance for this project was derived from Tech2 on youtube. 

This project marked my first easy-conpleted project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript in an attempt for me to learn by doing. This is the first of many. 
While I have about 5 other project ongoing, this easy projects would help to provide me with the neccesary background, knowledge, and understanding needed to grasp the concepts 
of the other bigger projects. 

The aim is to do as many as possible projects and complement it with reading in order to become a pro-programmer within the shortest possible period of time. 

## With this project, I have learnt

1. More about JavaScript functions
2. Use of query selectors
3. And how to obtain data from APIs
