# Meme-Generator

This is one of the first fun projects I completed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The inspiration and guidance for this project were derived from Tech2 on YouTube. 

This project marked my first easy-completed project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript in an attempt to learn by doing. This is the first of many. 
While I have about 5 other projects ongoing, these easy projects would help to provide me with the necessary background, knowledge, and understanding needed to grasp the concepts 
of the other bigger projects. 

The aim is to do as many as possible projects and complement it with reading in order to become a pro programmer within the shortest possible period of time. 

## With this project, I have learnt

1. More about JavaScript functions
2. Use of query selectors
3. And how to obtain data from APIs
